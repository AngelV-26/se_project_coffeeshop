# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is my second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A Custom Form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I plan on changing the Title to make the project more unique.
I also plan on styling the CSS to my liking in the forms section so everything is centered even the placeholders. 
I believe this looks better, but if i have to change it it is fine.
