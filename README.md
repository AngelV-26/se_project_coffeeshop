# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is my second project in the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## This Project Features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A Custom Form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I plan on changing the Title to Cafe Che Buono to make it more unique.
I was also thinking of changing the forms to center the place holder to be different.
I think the coffeeshop can be shared on TikTok as well, instead of just Instagram and Facebook.
There are a couple of menu items and prices that I changed as well.
